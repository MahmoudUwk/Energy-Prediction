# Electricity-Only Focus Update for ASHRAE Dataset

## 🎯 Objective
Focus the ASHRAE dataset on electricity meters only (meter = 0) to ensure direct comparability with the original Portuguese dataset's electrical load forecasting.

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. **Data Filtering**
```python
# Added to prepare_ashrae_data()
# Filter for electricity meters only (meter = 0)
X = X[X.meter == 0].copy()
```

### 2. **Simplified Feature Engineering**
- **Removed**: Meter type mapping and one-hot encoding
- **Before**: 4 meter categories (Electricity, ChilledWater, Steam, HotWater)
- **After**: Single focus on electricity meters only

### 3. **Updated Feature Count**
| Dataset | Previous Features | Current Features | Reduction |
|---------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Portuguese** | 6 | 6 | 0 |
| **ASHRAE** | ~32 | ~28-30 | ~4-6 features |

### 4. **Documentation Updates**
- ✅ Updated function docstrings in `preprocessing_ashrae.py`
- ✅ Updated `ASHRAE_Validation_Report.md`
- ✅ Updated `Dataset_Preprocessing_Comparison.md`
- ✅ Clarified electricity-only focus throughout

## 🎯 Benefits

### 1. **Fair Comparison**
- Both datasets now predict **electrical energy consumption**
- Removes energy type as a confounding variable
- Standardizes target variable domain

### 2. **Reduced Complexity**
- Eliminates meter category confusion
- Fewer one-hot encoded features
- Cleaner model input space

### 3. **Maintained Richness**
- Preserves building metadata diversity
- Retains weather data integration
- Keeps temporal feature engineering
- Maintains multi-building, multi-site context

## 📊 Updated Dataset Characteristics

### Target Variables Now Aligned
| Dataset | Target Variable | Units | Energy Type |
|---------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Portuguese** | Active Power (P) | kW/kWh | Electricity |
| **ASHRAE** | meter_reading | kWh (kBTU for Site 0) | **Electricity only** |

### Feature Complexity Comparison
- **Portuguese**: Simple 3-feature electrical dataset
- **ASHRAE**: Rich multi-building electrical dataset (~5x more features)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Code Changes
1. **Filtering**: Added `X = X[X.meter == 0].copy()` immediately after data selection
2. **Removed**: Meter category mapping and one-hot encoding
3. **Preserved**: All building, weather, and temporal features
4. **Maintained**: Existing normalization and data splitting logic

### No Breaking Changes
- All existing functions work with same signatures
- Model training pipelines remain unchanged
- Evaluation metrics unchanged
- Sequence length and data splits preserved

## ✅ Validation Status

The electricity-only ASHRAE preprocessing pipeline:
- ✅ Maintains MinMaxScaler consistency with original dataset
- ✅ Uses identical log1p/expm1 transformations  
- ✅ Preserves sliding window methodology
- ✅ Keeps same train/val/test split approach
- ✅ Focuses on electrical energy consumption only

## 🚀 Ready for Training

The ASHRAE dataset is now properly configured for **electrical load forecasting** comparison with the Portuguese dataset, enabling:

1. **Direct performance comparison** on electrical energy prediction
2. **Fair evaluation** of ModLSTM across different domains
3. **Rich feature analysis** using ASHRAE's building/weather context
4. **Reproducible research** with standardized target variables

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Electricity-only preprocessing implemented
2. ✅ Documentation updated
3. ⏳ **Ready**: Run model training with `ashrae/train_ashrae_lstm_comb.py`
4. ⏳ **Ready**: Compare performance with original Portuguese results
5. ⏳ **Ready**: Generate comparative plots with `plot_results.py`
